# Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Example

"fraud_data_EDA_model.ipynb" is the jupyter notebook file for Fraud_Data.csv file, which you can download from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/preritsaxena/fraud-detection) I've put a lot of comments in this file. I also explained logistic regression in a very round-about way, so I also included my logistic regression implementation from scratch.

"logistic_regression_from_scratch.py" is that file.

"https://www.kaggle.com/mssmartypants/water-quality" is the jupyter notebook file for "waterQuality1.csv" file. You can also download this from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mssmartypants/water-quality).
